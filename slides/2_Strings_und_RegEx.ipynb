      "[6] \"Nicht die Zustimmung, sondern der Widerspruch, welchen die nachstehenden Ausführungen bei vielen ihrer Hörer fanden, veranlaßten mich, sie zu veröffentlichen. Sachlich Neues werden sie Fachgenossen wie andern nur in Einzelheiten bringen, und in welchem speziellen Sinn allein sie den Anspruch auf das Prädikat der »Wissenschaftlichkeit« erheben, ergibt sich aus der Veranlassung ihres Entstehens. Eine Antrittsrede bietet eben Gelegenheit zur offenen Darlegung und Rechtfertigung des persönlichen und insoweit »subjektiven« Standpunktes bei der Beurteilung volkswirtschaftlicher Erscheinungen. Die Ausführungen S. 15 bis 18 (oben)hatte ich mit Rücksicht auf Zeit und Hörerkreis fortgelassen, andere mögen beim Sprechen eine andere Form angenommen haben. Zu den Darlegungen im Eingang ist zu bemerken, daß die Vorgänge hier naturgemäß wesentlich vereinfacht gegenüber der Wirklichkeit dargestellt werden. Die Zeit von 1871–1885 zeigt in den einzelnen Kreisen und Gemeinden Westpreußens keine einheitlichen, sondern charakteristisch wechselnde Bevölkerungsbewegungen, die keineswegs durchweg so durchsichtig sind wie die herausgegriffenen Beispiele. Die Tendenz, welche an diesen zu veranschaulichen versucht ist, wird in anderen Fällen durch andere Momente durchkreuzt. Darauf werde ich demnächst ausführlicher an anderem Ort zurückkommen. Daß die Resultate, welche diese Zahlen bieten können, auf unsichereren Füßen stehen als diejenigen, welche die verdienstlichen Veröffentlichungen mehrerer Schüler Neumanns uns über die Nationalitätsverhältnisse in Posen und Westpreußen geliefert haben, liegt auf der Hand.

      "[1] \"Der Nationalstaat und die Volkswirtschaftspolitik\\n\\n1895\\nVorbemerkung\\n\\nNicht die Zustimmung, sondern der Widerspruch, welchen die nachstehenden Ausführungen bei vielen ihrer Hörer fanden, veranlaßten mich, sie zu veröffentlichen. Sachlich Neues werden sie Fachgenossen wie andern nur in Einzelheiten bringen, und in welchem speziellen Sinn allein sie den Anspruch auf das Prädikat der »Wissenschaftlichkeit« erheben, ergibt sich aus der Veranlassung ihres Entstehens. Eine Antrittsrede bietet eben Gelegenheit zur offenen Darlegung und Rechtfertigung des persönlichen und insoweit »subjektiven« Standpunktes bei der Beurteilung volkswirtschaftlicher Erscheinungen. Die Ausführungen S. 15 bis 18 (oben)hatte ich mit Rücksicht auf Zeit und Hörerkreis fortgelassen, andere mögen beim Sprechen eine andere Form angenommen haben. Zu den Darlegungen im Eingang ist zu bemerken, daß die Vorgänge hier naturgemäß wesentlich vereinfacht gegenüber der Wirklichkeit dargestellt werden. Die Zeit von 1871–1885 zeigt in den einzelnen Kreisen und Gemeinden Westpreußens keine einheitlichen, sondern charakteristisch wechselnde Bevölkerungsbewegungen, die keineswegs durchweg so durchsichtig sind wie die herausgegriffenen Beispiele. Die Tendenz, welche an diesen zu veranschaulichen versucht ist, wird in anderen Fällen durch andere Momente durchkreuzt. Darauf werde ich demnächst ausführlicher an anderem Ort zurückkommen. Daß die Resultate, welche diese Zahlen bieten können, auf unsichereren Füßen stehen als diejenigen, welche die verdienstlichen Veröffentlichungen mehrerer Schüler Neumanns uns über die Nationalitätsverhältnisse in Posen und Westpreußen geliefert haben, liegt auf der Hand. Aber in Ermangelung korrekten Materials müssen wir uns vorerst mit ihnen begnügen, zumal die Erscheinungen, welche sie veranschaulichen, uns in ihren Hauptzügen bereits aus den ländlichen Enqueten der letzten Jahre bekannt sind.\\n\\nFreiburg, Mai 1895\\nMax Weber\\n\"\n"

The effects of these reforms depend on the market where control rights over incumbent firms are traded. In the absence of a market for control, both reforms increase the number and the average quality of firms, and are politically equivalent. When a market for control exists, financial reform induces less entry than deregulation, and endogenously compensates incumbents, thereby encountering less political opposition from them. Using this result, we show that financial reform may be used in the short run to open the way for future deregulation. Our model sheds light on the privatization and reform experiences of formerly planned economies as well as on the observed path of reforms in economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>Q.

The winner's curse hypothesis posits suboptimal behavior in which winning bidders fail to adapt their strategies to the level of competition and the amount of uncertainty in the takeover environment and predicts that bidder returns are inversely related to the level of competition in a given deal and to the uncertainty in the value of the target. Our measure of takeover competition comes from a unique data set on the auction process that occurs prior to the announcement of a takeover. In our empirical estimation, we control for the endogeneity between bidder returns and the level of competition in takeover deals. Controlling for endogeneity, we find that the returns to bidders are not significantly related to takeover competition. We also find that uncertainty in the value of the target does not reduce bidder returns. Related analysis indicates that prestigious investment banks do not promote overbidding. Analysis of post-takeover operating performance also fails to find any negative effects of takeover competition. As a whole, the results indicate that the breakeven returns to bidders in corporate takeovers stem not from the winner's curse but from the competitive market for targets that occurs predominantly prior to the public announcement of bids.

Adverse selection is procyclical in the sense that dispersion in unobservable quality across firms should be more pronounced during booms. Taking the premise that uncertainty is resolved (and thus private information revealed) over time, we test this hypothesis by looking at long-rum abnormal returns and delisting rates. Consistent with the model, we find (a) greater cross-sectional return variance, and (b) higher incidence of delisting for hot-market IPOs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We test these predictions using two proxies for overconfidence: CEOs' personal over-investment in their company and their press portrayal. We find that the odds of making an acquisition are 65% higher if the CEO is classified as overconfident. The effect is largest if the merger is diversifying and does not require external financing. The market reaction at merger announcement (-90 basis points) is significantly more negative than for non-overconfident CEOs (-12 basis points). We consider alternative interpretations including inside information, signaling, and risk tolerance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We also find that after restatement, the number of lenders per loan declines and firms pay higher upfront and annual fees. These results are consistent with banks using tighter loan contract terms to overcome risk and information problems arising from financial restatements. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Although there are hints of reductions in the propensity to pay dividends in most of the sample countries over the 1994-2002 period, they are driven by a failure of newly listed firms to initiate dividends when expected to do so. Dividend abandonment and the failure to initiate by existing nonpayers are economically unimportant except in Japan. Moreover, in each country, aggregate dividends have not declined and are concentrated among the largest. most profitable firms. Finally, outside of the US there is little evidence of a systematic positive relation between relative prices of dividend paying and non-paying firms and the propensity to pay dividends. Overall, these findings cast doubt on signaling, clientele. and catering explanations for dividends, but support agency cost-based lifecycle theories. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To shed light on this important question, I develop a simple model of two candidate electoral competitions in which candidates may be either office or policy motivated. In a second departure from standard formulations, the model incorporates both campaign and post-election behaviour of candidates. In this environment, I find that office-motivated candidates are favoured in electoral competition but that their advantage is limited by the electoral mechanism itself and policy-motivated candidates win a significant fraction of elections. More importantly, I show that the competitive interaction among candidates of different motivations affects the incentives of all candidates-both office and policy motivated-and that this competition affects policy outcomes. I also extend the model to explore the decision of citizens to enter politics and show that in all equilibria policy-motivated citizens compose a majority of the candidate pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td><td>Rev.

The data sets from the two tasks are largely inconsistent. Rather, we find evidence that the subjects perceive the games differently when they (i) choose actions and (ii) state beliefs-their stated beliefs reveal deeper strategic thinking than their actions. On average, they fail to best respond to their own stated beliefs in almost half of the games. The inconsistency is confirmed by estimates of a unified statistical model that jointly uses the actions and the belief statements. There, we can control for decision noise and formulate a statistical test that rejects consistency.

Using detailed plot-level data from rural Pakistan, we find that non-contractible investment is underprovided on tenanted land, even after controlling for the endogeneity of leasing decisions. Our evidence also indicates that moral hazard in investment effort alone cannot explain this inefficiency. Instead, imperfect commitment appears to be the driving mechanism, since even plots taken on fixed rent contracts where all the rent is paid upfront receive lower investment than owner-cultivated plots. We further show that a considerable portion of the variation in tenancy duration, and hence in the security of tenure, is due to heterogeneity across landlords.

For a calibrated economy, we find that when the only tax base available to the government is capital income-an inelastic source of funds at any point in time-the government still refrains from taxing at confiscatory rates. We also find that when the only tax base is labour income the Markov equilibrium features less public expenditure and lower tax rates than the Ramsey equilibrium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>Rev.

In particular, it shows that competitive financial contracts can result in excessive borrowing ex ante and excessive volatility ex post. Even though from a first-best perspective the equilibrium always displays under-borrowing, from a second-best point of view excessive borrowing can arise. The inefficiency is due to the combination of limited commitment in financial contracts and the fact that asset prices are determined in a spot market. This generates a pecuniary externality that is not internalized in private contracts. The model provides a framework to evaluate preventive policies, which can be used during a credit boom to reduce the expected costs of a financial crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td><td>Rev.

We show that the conventional wisdom that trade promotes peace is only partially true even in a model where trade is economically beneficial, military conflicts reduce trade, and leaders are rational. When war can occur because of the presence of asymmetric information, the probability of escalation is lower for countries that trade more bilaterally because of the opportunity cost associated with the loss of trade gains. However, countries more open to global trade have a higher probability of war because multilateral trade openness decreases bilateral dependence to any given country and the cost of a bilateral conflict. We test our predictions on a large data set of military conflicts on the 1950-2000 period. Using different strategies to solve the endogeneity issues, including instrumental variables, we find robust evidence for the contrasting effects of bilateral and multilateral trade openness. For proximate countries, we find that trade has had a surprisingly large effect on their probability of military conflict.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td><td>Rev.

From a positive standpoint, the KFG rule is at odds with many episodes in which the central bank has plenty of international reserves at the time of abandonment. We study the optimal exit policy and show that from a normative standpoint, the KFG rule is generally suboptimal. We consider a model in which the fixed exchange rate regime has become unsustainable due to an unexpected increase in government spending. We show that when there are no exit costs, it is optimal to abandon immediately. When there are exit costs, the optimal abandonment time is a decreasing function of the size of the fiscal shock. For large fiscal shocks, immediate abandonment is optimal. Our model is consistent with evidence suggesting that many countries exit fixed exchange rate regimes with still plenty of international reserves in the central bank's vault.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>Rev.

During employment, the output path stochastically drives the agent's continuation value until it reaches a point that triggers retirement, quitting, replacement, or promotion.

The error term epsilon is assumed to be uncorrelated with a set of instruments z, epsilon is independent of upsilon conditionally on x and z, and the support of - (x beta + epsilon) is finite. We provide a sharp characterization of the set of observationally equivalent parameters beta. When there are as many instruments z as variables x, the bounds of the identified intervals of the different scalar components beta(k) of parameter beta can be expressed as simple moments of the data. Also, in the case of interval data, we show that additional information on the distribution of upsilon within intervals shrinks the identified set. Specifically, the closer the conditional distribution of upsilon given z is to uniformity, the smaller is the identified set. Point identified is achieved if and only if upsilon is uniform within intervals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </span></td><td>Rev.

We test the assumption of price inelastic demand using randomized trials conducted by a consumer lender in South Africa. The demand curves are downward sloping, and sleeper for price increases relative to the lender's standard rates.

Default is more likely in recessions because this is when it is more costly for a risk averse borrower to repay noncontingent debt. The model closely matches business cycles in Argentina predicting high volatility of interest rates, higher volatility of consumption relative to output, and negative correlations of output with interest rates and the trade balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td><td>Am.

In contrast, our analysis shows that the share of liquid assets that households invest in risky assets is not affected by wealth changes. Instead, one of the major drivers of household portfolio allocation seems to be inertia: households rebalance only very slowly following inflows and outflows or capital gains and losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td><td>Am.

The estimated elasticity is high-between 6 and 14.

Nevertheless, little is known about children's comprehension about occupational hierarchy related to what adults in distinct occupations are able to consume and save. The aim of this study was to analyze this comprehension in order to understand the development of concepts that interweave in children's and adolescents' societal and economic knowledge. Two hundred and ten children between 6 and 16 years of age were sampled from urban and rural social backgrounds. The children were individually interviewed about what four persons with distinct occupations consume and save. The results show that, across all occupations, children are more likely to identify saving as a likely response to obtaining extra income from a raffle as they get older. In terms of identifying motives for saving, mentions of saving for future purchases decrease with age, whilst precautionary saving and saving for investment are mentioned more often by older children.

Using a sample of 1758 children ages 6-14 and their parents living in three Mainland Chinese cities with different levels of advertising development, we examined children's understanding of television advertising by age utilizing a verbal method. Results of logistic regression analyses indicated that the cognitive developmental model made a greater contribution to predicting children's understanding of commercial communications than the social learning model. Chinese parents were not important socializing agents and television played some role ill children's consumer socialization. Gender, household income and the media environment had impact oil children's understanding of commercial communications. Girls and children from families with high household income had a higher understanding. Children residing in cities with the presence of public service advertising had a lower understanding of commercial communications. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the length of the game, and therefore the future, was unknown to the players. Results Suggest that between the ages nine and twelve children acquire the ability to manage their money on a formal level; e.g. they learn to deal with bank accounts and banking facilities in a useful, functional way. Twelve-year-olds frequently made use of the deposit facility of the bank in order to avoid temptation. For the second study, the game was altered so that children's ability to adopt a precautionary saving Motive Could be examined. In this study, players were told about the length of the game. Thirty-six children (nineteen 6-8 year olds and sixteen 10-11 year olds) took part, with both age groups being equally successful but using different strategies to cope with high or low fluctuations in income during the game.

The article also addresses his view of the importance of the professions to an understanding of the nature of advanced capitalism. The professions are discussed as both an illustration of his theoretical argument and a substantive problem that stimulated the development of his theory. The \"professional complex\" is an emergent phenomenon in capitalism that modifies its operation and points to the complexity of systems of social action that require to be analyzed without being reduced to one of their elements. This reductionism is evident in orthodox economic theory and also in the more sociologically-oriented approach of institutional economics. Parsons argues that each is a form of what, following Whitehead, he calls the \"fallacy of misplaced concreteness.\" Although Parsons offers a significant critique of dominant approaches in economics, major flaws within his own theory create the appearance that he has simply carried over the deficiencies of orthodox theory into his own general statement of theory. These flaws contribute to major misunderstandings of Parsons's project and, therefore, indicate continuing problems in the relation between economics and sociology.</td><td>Am. J. Econ.

Parsons's contributions on this subject were, however, mostly critically received in the new economic sociology. In this article, main points of criticism of Parsons's economic sociology will be discussed and the question asked whether the importance of Parsons's works in economic sociology was adequately treated. It will be demonstrated that the critical assessments was based for the most part on theoretical conceptions Parsons developed during his structural-functionalist period. Hence the assessments neglected to discuss the theory of expressive-symbolic communication of affect that Parsons developed in his later systems-functionalist period. However, precisely these later theoretical developments correlate directly with the concept of social embeddedness as a key concept in the new economic sociology. A stronger linking with this development in Parsons's theory could bring economic sociology closer to finding a foundation in action theory, which has been missing up to the present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td><td>Am.

Particularly, the hypergrowth and ubiquity of financial markets has triggered controversial debates on how to understand today's economic landscape. With the objective of clarifying the relationship between finance and economy, this article restructures the present debate through the lenses of Talcott Parsons's and Niklas Luhmann's theories of social systems. Basic system-theoretical ideas on social aspects of finance and economy as well as on uncertainty and risk hint at new insights into the global system of finance that might go far beyond explanatory models of causality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>Am.

These bridges are methodological or epistemological and theoretical or substantive ones. A relevant instance of the methodological bridges is socioeconomic holism, epitomized in the systems approach to economy and society. An important case of the theoretical bridges is sociological institutionalism. The holistic systems approach is a pertinent methodological bridge in that it treats the economy as an integral element of society as a larger system, and consequently treats economics as part of the complex of social sciences. Sociological institutionalism is an important theoretical bridge to (especially institutional) economics by virtue of its emphasis on social institutions and their economic significance.

This self-other discrepancy in tax ethics could undermine people's tax compliance as they conform to the misperceived social norm. Feedback about the self-other discrepancy could correct the misperception and improve compliance. This approach was first tested in a scenario study with 64 students. Respondents showed the expected self-other discrepancy in tax ethics and feedback about the finding increased their hypothetical compliance. Further results showed that the effect was due to the intervention improving the perception of others' tax ethics, as expected. Study 2, a field experiment with 1500 Australian taxpayers, replicated the self-other discrepancy and provided taxpayers with information about the result. Compared to control groups, the feedback did not affect work-related expenses claims but significantly reduced other deduction claims. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Findings revealed that 50% of respondents had structuralistic, almost 30% had individualistic, and about 20% hold fatalistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty. Farmers with individualistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty had higher quality of life, well-being, level of agricultural technology, agricultural production, used insurance more often, they had more land, income, access to agricultural extension services and practiced sustainable agriculture more often. Farmers with fatalistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty had the worst condition with regard to the above variables. However, those who had structuralistic attitudes, stood somewhere between the two previous groups. Based on findings, a number of poverty alleviation recommendations are made. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A sample of household partners judged the fairness of a number of hypothetical decisions of a household partner, varying in the context of the decision. Decisions made by the partner to make a large personal expenditure or to reduce time spent on household chores were considered by the subjects as more fair if the outcome was framed as a forgone gain then if it was framed as a straight loss. Partners' decisions to reduce household chores were also considered as more fair in the case of overtime work than when the partner received a salary increase or windfall income. We conclude that asymmetric valuation of losses and forgone gains, and (behavioral) costs as compared with income increase of the partner, influenced the fairness judgments concerning the partner's behavior.

Second, co-operation is difficult as a consequence of specific characteristics of the collective action problem involved. The actors face a prisoners' dilemma. Both explanations have their limits. The first approach is not very good at predicting actual policy preferences of governments and the second approach dismisses the fact that the EU offers cooperative institutions that should be able to resolve a dilemma.

In the case of B2C Internet commerce, the information asymmetry typically relates to the difficulty that consumers have of distinguishing between \"trustworthy\" and \"untrustworthy\" Web merchants. The impasse can be resolved by the use of signals by trustworthy Web merchants to differentiate themselves from untrustworthy ones. Using an experimental design where subjects are exposed to a series of purchase choices, we investigate three possible signals, an unconditional money-back guarantee, branding, and privacy statement, and test their efficacy. Our empirical results confirm the predictions suggested by signalling theory. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The average increase in the psychological distress is greater when outstanding credit is measured at the individual, as opposed to household, level. No such significant association is found in the case of mortgage debt. Our results highlight the psychological cost associated with the consumer credit culture in Britain. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In doing so, it offers several new features: Firstly, it provides a joint analysis of lotteries and income distributions. Secondly, the stimulus material used is considerably more general than used so far in the analysis of preference reversal. Instead of relying on binary lotteries and income distributions, we used ten multiple-outcome lotteries and ten n-dimensional income distributions which corresponded exactly to the lotteries. The lotteries and income distributions were chosen so as to model generalized P-bets (negatively skewed distributions) and generalized $-bets (positively skewed distributions), but we also used other shapes (uniform, symmetrical, and bimodal distributions). Thirdly, we applied material incentives to our subjects which were recruited from students of the Universities of Bari, Italy, and Castellon, Spain. Subjects were asked both to rate and evaluate the ten lotteries or the ten income distributions, respectively. We found heavy response-mode effects which confirm classical preference reversal, and revealed new patterns of preference reversal. Further, the transfer principle was largely violated.

As we are all equally sovereign (cognitive-wise), we only strike deals that inevitably make us better off. We all gain from trade and thus, as everyone is better off, so must be the whole of society. But could it be that people are rational yet not equally sovereign? In this paper, we examine Smith's interpretation of rationality, and we find that it is fundamentally a social concept. As such, the manifestation of rationality in individual behavior depends on how sophisticated is individuals' access to public opinion. Consequently, individuals who are equally self-interested may face very different sets of options, which are determined by their social circumstances.

While the theory has intuitive appeal, it remains controversial. This study considers a data set first presented by Levitt and Venkatesh (2000) that details a drug-selling gang's activities. In this gang, low-ranking criminals accept low initial wages in the hope of receiving high future remunerations. As demonstrated in the note, this wage structure is exceedingly difficult to reconcile (both theoretically and empirically) with the notion of present-oriented criminals.

This is surprising, as Miksch provides insights into the debates within the so-called \"Freiburg School of Law and Economics\" in its early phase and, moreover, gave impulses that were essential to the further development of this economic approach. In addition, as a close advisor to Ludwig Erhard, the \"political father\" of the German \"Social Market Economy,\" his influence on German postwar economic policy was considerable. Furthermore, Miksch's thinking on the combination of market forms and market constitution, as formulated primarily in his habilitation thesis on \"Competition as Task\" (1937) supervised by Walter Eucken, is unique and inventive. We will show that his ideas on economic policy culminating in the reference model of \"competition as-if\" as well as the connection he established with the economic foundation of democracy are of enduring relevance. The latter insight characterizes Miksch as an (overlooked) precursor of constitutional economics, which was later developed independently by James M.

There is, however, no doubt that such a market-oriented sociology is still in its infancy, given among other issues its inability to shoulder market change. The void thus recognized opens up the potential for a market idea with both social and dynamic properties. There is good reason to believe that such an endeavor would benefit from the constructive blending of economic sociology and Austrian economics.

In the absence of a market for control, both reforms increase the number and the average quality of firms, and are politically equivalent. When a market for control exists, financial reform induces less entry than deregulation, and endogenously compensates incumbents, thereby encountering less political opposition from them. Using this result, we show that financial reform may be used in the short run to open the way for future deregulation. Our model sheds light on the privatization and reform experiences of formerly planned economies as well as on the observed path of reforms in economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & Q.

The winner's curse hypothesis posits suboptimal behavior in which winning bidders fail to adapt their strategies to the level of competition and the amount of uncertainty in the takeover environment and predicts that bidder returns are inversely related to the level of competition in a given deal and to the uncertainty in the value of the target. Our measure of takeover competition comes from a unique data set on the auction process that occurs prior to the announcement of a takeover. In our empirical estimation, we control for the endogeneity between bidder returns and the level of competition in takeover deals. Controlling for endogeneity, we find that the returns to bidders are not significantly related to takeover competition. We also find that uncertainty in the value of the target does not reduce bidder returns. Related analysis indicates that prestigious investment banks do not promote overbidding. Analysis of post-takeover operating performance also fails to find any negative effects of takeover competition. As a whole, the results indicate that the breakeven returns to bidders in corporate takeovers stem not from the winner's curse but from the competitive market for targets that occurs predominantly prior to the public announcement of bids.

The model is consistent with several stylized facts known about the IPO market: economic expansions are associated with a dramatic increase in the number of firms going public, which is in turn positively correlated with underpricing. Adverse selection is procyclical in the sense that dispersion in unobservable quality across firms should be more pronounced during booms. Taking the premise that uncertainty is resolved (and thus private information revealed) over time, we test this hypothesis by looking at long-rum abnormal returns and delisting rates. Consistent with the model, we find (a) greater cross-sectional return variance, and (b) higher incidence of delisting for hot-market IPOs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Overconfident CEOs overestimate their ability to generate returns. As a result, they overpay for target companies and undertake value-destroying mergers. The effects are strongest if they have access to internal financing. We test these predictions using two proxies for overconfidence: CEOs' personal over-investment in their company and their press portrayal. We find that the odds of making an acquisition are 65\\% higher if the CEO is classified as overconfident. The effect is largest if the merger is diversifying and does not require external financing. The market reaction at merger announcement (-90 basis points) is significantly more negative than for non-overconfident CEOs (-12 basis points).

Although there are hints of reductions in the propensity to pay dividends in most of the sample countries over the 1994-2002 period, they are driven by a failure of newly listed firms to initiate dividends when expected to do so. Dividend abandonment and the failure to initiate by existing nonpayers are economically unimportant except in Japan. Moreover, in each country, aggregate dividends have not declined and are concentrated among the largest. most profitable firms. Finally, outside of the US there is little evidence of a systematic positive relation between relative prices of dividend paying and non-paying firms and the propensity to pay dividends. Overall, these findings cast doubt on signaling, clientele. and catering explanations for dividends, but support agency cost-based lifecycle theories. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We prove that the optimal mechanism derived using standard mechanism design techniques has a bad equilibrium (a tax riot) where households underreport their incomes, precisely because other households are expected to do so as well. We then consider three alternative approaches to designing a tax scheme when one is worried about bad equilibria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & Rev.

To shed light on this important question, I develop a simple model of two candidate electoral competitions in which candidates may be either office or policy motivated. In a second departure from standard formulations, the model incorporates both campaign and post-election behaviour of candidates. In this environment, I find that office-motivated candidates are favoured in electoral competition but that their advantage is limited by the electoral mechanism itself and policy-motivated candidates win a significant fraction of elections. More importantly, I show that the competitive interaction among candidates of different motivations affects the incentives of all candidates-both office and policy motivated-and that this competition affects policy outcomes. I also extend the model to explore the decision of citizens to enter politics and show that in all equilibria policy-motivated citizens compose a majority of the candidate pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  & Rev.

Political parties are less likely to choose partisan policies when more voters consume informative news. When there are two media outlets, each should be slightly biased relative to its audience in order to attract voters with relatively extreme views. Voter welfare is typically higher under a duopoly than under a monopoly. Two media outlets under joint ownership may provide more diverse viewpoints than two independent ones, but voter welfare is not always higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & Rev.

In our laboratory experiments, subjects play a set of 14 two-person 3 x 3 games and state beliefs about which actions they expect their opponents to play. The data sets from the two tasks are largely inconsistent. Rather, we find evidence that the subjects perceive the games differently when they (i) choose actions and (ii) state beliefs-their stated beliefs reveal deeper strategic thinking than their actions. On average, they fail to best respond to their own stated beliefs in almost half of the games. The inconsistency is confirmed by estimates of a unified statistical model that jointly uses the actions and the belief statements. There, we can control for decision noise and formulate a statistical test that rejects consistency. Effects of the belief elicitation procedure on subsequent actions are mostly insignificant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           & Rev.

Using detailed plot-level data from rural Pakistan, we find that non-contractible investment is underprovided on tenanted land, even after controlling for the endogeneity of leasing decisions. Our evidence also indicates that moral hazard in investment effort alone cannot explain this inefficiency. Instead, imperfect commitment appears to be the driving mechanism, since even plots taken on fixed rent contracts where all the rent is paid upfront receive lower investment than owner-cultivated plots. We further show that a considerable portion of the variation in tenancy duration, and hence in the security of tenure, is due to heterogeneity across landlords. One interpretation of this finding is that landlord reputation is important in mitigating hold-up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & Rev.

We characterize and solve for Markov-perfect equilibria of the dynamic game between successive governments. The characterization consists of an inter-temporal first-order condition (a \"generalized Euler equation\") for the government, and we use it both to gain insight into the nature of the equilibrium and as a basis for computations. For a calibrated economy, we find that when the only tax base available to the government is capital income-an inelastic source of funds at any point in time-the government still refrains from taxing at confiscatory rates.

In particular, it shows that competitive financial contracts can result in excessive borrowing ex ante and excessive volatility ex post. Even though from a first-best perspective the equilibrium always displays under-borrowing, from a second-best point of view excessive borrowing can arise. The inefficiency is due to the combination of limited commitment in financial contracts and the fact that asset prices are determined in a spot market. This generates a pecuniary externality that is not internalized in private contracts. The model provides a framework to evaluate preventive policies, which can be used during a credit boom to reduce the expected costs of a financial crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & Rev.

We show that the conventional wisdom that trade promotes peace is only partially true even in a model where trade is economically beneficial, military conflicts reduce trade, and leaders are rational. When war can occur because of the presence of asymmetric information, the probability of escalation is lower for countries that trade more bilaterally because of the opportunity cost associated with the loss of trade gains. However, countries more open to global trade have a higher probability of war because multilateral trade openness decreases bilateral dependence to any given country and the cost of a bilateral conflict. We test our predictions on a large data set of military conflicts on the 1950-2000 period. Using different strategies to solve the endogeneity issues, including instrumental variables, we find robust evidence for the contrasting effects of bilateral and multilateral trade openness. For proximate countries, we find that trade has had a surprisingly large effect on their probability of military conflict.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & Rev.

We study the optimal exit policy and show that from a normative standpoint, the KFG rule is generally suboptimal. We consider a model in which the fixed exchange rate regime has become unsustainable due to an unexpected increase in government spending. We show that when there are no exit costs, it is optimal to abandon immediately. When there are exit costs, the optimal abandonment time is a decreasing function of the size of the fiscal shock. For large fiscal shocks, immediate abandonment is optimal. Our model is consistent with evidence suggesting that many countries exit fixed exchange rate regimes with still plenty of international reserves in the central bank's vault.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & Rev.

During employment, the output path stochastically drives the agent's continuation value until it reaches a point that triggers retirement, quitting, replacement, or promotion.

We provide a sharp characterization of the set of observationally equivalent parameters beta.

Also, in the case of interval data, we show that additional information on the distribution of upsilon within intervals shrinks the identified set.

We find that a history of unenforced property rights hinders our subjects' ability to develop the requisite personal social arrangements to support specialization and effectively exploit impersonal long-distance trade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & Am.

This strategy makes sense if the poor are rate insensitive: then microlenders increase profitability (or achieve sustainability) without reducing the poor's access to credit. We test the assumption of price inelastic demand using randomized trials conducted by a consumer lender in South Africa. The demand curves are downward sloping, and sleeper for price increases relative to the lender's standard rates.

In contrast, our analysis shows that the share of liquid assets that households invest in risky assets is not affected by wealth changes. Instead, one of the major drivers of household portfolio allocation seems to be inertia: households rebalance only very slowly following inflows and outflows or capital gains and losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & Am.

Consequently, investment prices should fully reflect temporary tax subsidies, regardless of the investment supply elasticity. Since prices move one for-one with the subsidy, elasticities can be inferred from quantities alone. This paper uses a recent tax policy-bonus depreciation-to estimate the investment supply elasticity. Investment in qualified capital increased sharply. The estimated elasticity is high-between 6 and 14. There is no evidence that market prices reacted to the subsidy, suggesting that adjustment costs are internal, or that measurement error masks the price changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & Am.

Nevertheless, little is known about children's comprehension about occupational hierarchy related to what adults in distinct occupations are able to consume and save. The aim of this study was to analyze this comprehension in order to understand the development of concepts that interweave in children's and adolescents' societal and economic knowledge. Two hundred and ten children between 6 and 16 years of age were sampled from urban and rural social backgrounds. The children were individually interviewed about what four persons with distinct occupations consume and save. The results show that, across all occupations, children are more likely to identify saving as a likely response to obtaining extra income from a raffle as they get older. In terms of identifying motives for saving, mentions of saving for future purchases decrease with age, whilst precautionary saving and saving for investment are mentioned more often by older children.

Using a sample of 1758 children ages 6-14 and their parents living in three Mainland Chinese cities with different levels of advertising development, we examined children's understanding of television advertising by age utilizing a verbal method. Results of logistic regression analyses indicated that the cognitive developmental model made a greater contribution to predicting children's understanding of commercial communications than the social learning model. Chinese parents were not important socializing agents and television played some role ill children's consumer socialization. Gender, household income and the media environment had impact oil children's understanding of commercial communications. Girls and children from families with high household income had a higher understanding. Children residing in cities with the presence of public service advertising had a lower understanding of commercial communications. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the length of the game, and therefore the future, was unknown to the players. Results Suggest that between the ages nine and twelve children acquire the ability to manage their money on a formal level; e.g. they learn to deal with bank accounts and banking facilities in a useful, functional way. Twelve-year-olds frequently made use of the deposit facility of the bank in order to avoid temptation.

Thirty-six children (nineteen 6-8 year olds and sixteen 10-11 year olds) took part, with both age groups being equally successful but using different strategies to cope with high or low fluctuations in income during the game.

The article also addresses his view of the importance of the professions to an understanding of the nature of advanced capitalism. The professions are discussed as both an illustration of his theoretical argument and a substantive problem that stimulated the development of his theory. The \"professional complex\" is an emergent phenomenon in capitalism that modifies its operation and points to the complexity of systems of social action that require to be analyzed without being reduced to one of their elements. This reductionism is evident in orthodox economic theory and also in the more sociologically-oriented approach of institutional economics. Parsons argues that each is a form of what, following Whitehead, he calls the \"fallacy of misplaced concreteness.\" Although Parsons offers a significant critique of dominant approaches in economics, major flaws within his own theory create the appearance that he has simply carried over the deficiencies of orthodox theory into his own general statement of theory. These flaws contribute to major misunderstandings of Parsons's project and, therefore, indicate continuing problems in the relation between economics and sociology. & Am. J. Econ.

In this article, main points of criticism of Parsons's economic sociology will be discussed and the question asked whether the importance of Parsons's works in economic sociology was adequately treated. It will be demonstrated that the critical assessments was based for the most part on theoretical conceptions Parsons developed during his structural-functionalist period. Hence the assessments neglected to discuss the theory of expressive-symbolic communication of affect that Parsons developed in his later systems-functionalist period. However, precisely these later theoretical developments correlate directly with the concept of social embeddedness as a key concept in the new economic sociology. A stronger linking with this development in Parsons's theory could bring economic sociology closer to finding a foundation in action theory, which has been missing up to the present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & Am.

While a considerable body of empirical investigations seems to provide evidence of positive correlations between stock market development and economic growth, there is no consensus in other social sciences as to whether there are two-way linkages, and if so, how to conceive a possible mechanism of interaction. Particularly, the hypergrowth and ubiquity of financial markets has triggered controversial debates on how to understand today's economic landscape. With the objective of clarifying the relationship between finance and economy, this article restructures the present debate through the lenses of Talcott Parsons's and Niklas Luhmann's theories of social systems. Basic system-theoretical ideas on social aspects of finance and economy as well as on uncertainty and risk hint at new insights into the global system of finance that might go far beyond explanatory models of causality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & Am.

These bridges are methodological or epistemological and theoretical or substantive ones. A relevant instance of the methodological bridges is socioeconomic holism, epitomized in the systems approach to economy and society. An important case of the theoretical bridges is sociological institutionalism. The holistic systems approach is a pertinent methodological bridge in that it treats the economy as an integral element of society as a larger system, and consequently treats economics as part of the complex of social sciences. Sociological institutionalism is an important theoretical bridge to (especially institutional) economics by virtue of its emphasis on social institutions and their economic significance. Some other methodological and theoretical bridges of Parsonian economic sociology to contemporary economics are also identified and discussed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & Am.

This self-other discrepancy in tax ethics could undermine people's tax compliance as they conform to the misperceived social norm. Feedback about the self-other discrepancy could correct the misperception and improve compliance. This approach was first tested in a scenario study with 64 students. Respondents showed the expected self-other discrepancy in tax ethics and feedback about the finding increased their hypothetical compliance. Further results showed that the effect was due to the intervention improving the perception of others' tax ethics, as expected. Study 2, a field experiment with 1500 Australian taxpayers, replicated the self-other discrepancy and provided taxpayers with information about the result. Compared to control groups, the feedback did not affect work-related expenses claims but significantly reduced other deduction claims. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Findings revealed that 50\\% of respondents had structuralistic, almost 30\\% had individualistic, and about 20\\% hold fatalistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty. Farmers with individualistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty had higher quality of life, well-being, level of agricultural technology, agricultural production, used insurance more often, they had more land, income, access to agricultural extension services and practiced sustainable agriculture more often. Farmers with fatalistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty had the worst condition with regard to the above variables.

A sample of household partners judged the fairness of a number of hypothetical decisions of a household partner, varying in the context of the decision. Decisions made by the partner to make a large personal expenditure or to reduce time spent on household chores were considered by the subjects as more fair if the outcome was framed as a forgone gain then if it was framed as a straight loss. Partners' decisions to reduce household chores were also considered as more fair in the case of overtime work than when the partner received a salary increase or windfall income. We conclude that asymmetric valuation of losses and forgone gains, and (behavioral) costs as compared with income increase of the partner, influenced the fairness judgments concerning the partner's behavior.

An efficient allocation of items is characterized, which may satisfy such properties as maximin, Borda maximin, and envy-avoidance. Whereas the two maximin properties are in conflict with envy-avoidance, there is always an efficient allocation that does not ensure envy, but it may not be maximin or Borda maximin. Computer calculations show that maximin allocations lead to envy quite often, but Borda maximin allocations do so only rarely.

Political science has offered two explanations for this. First, co-operation is difficult to achieve as a result of heterogeneity. Countries with a small domestic tax base favor tax competition, while countries with a large tax base prefer tax co-operation. Second, co-operation is difficult as a consequence of specific characteristics of the collective action problem involved. The actors face a prisoners' dilemma. Both explanations have their limits. The first approach is not very good at predicting actual policy preferences of governments and the second approach dismisses the fact that the EU offers cooperative institutions that should be able to resolve a dilemma.

The average increase in the psychological distress is greater when outstanding credit is measured at the individual, as opposed to household, level.

In doing so, it offers several new features: Firstly, it provides a joint analysis of lotteries and income distributions. Secondly, the stimulus material used is considerably more general than used so far in the analysis of preference reversal. Instead of relying on binary lotteries and income distributions, we used ten multiple-outcome lotteries and ten n-dimensional income distributions which corresponded exactly to the lotteries. The lotteries and income distributions were chosen so as to model generalized P-bets (negatively skewed distributions) and generalized \\$-bets (positively skewed distributions), but we also used other shapes (uniform, symmetrical, and bimodal distributions). Thirdly, we applied material incentives to our subjects which were recruited from students of the Universities of Bari, Italy, and Castellon, Spain. Subjects were asked both to rate and evaluate the ten lotteries or the ten income distributions, respectively. We found heavy response-mode effects which confirm classical preference reversal, and revealed new patterns of preference reversal. Further, the transfer principle was largely violated.

Mutual cooperation is triggered by assuming that what one person passes on to the next is multiplied by a factor of 3. Participants play repeatedly either in a partners or in a strangers condition and take their decisions first simultaneously and then sequentially. We find that pure indirect reciprocity enables mutual cooperation, although strategic considerations and group size are important too. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

As we are all equally sovereign (cognitive-wise), we only strike deals that inevitably make us better off. We all gain from trade and thus, as everyone is better off, so must be the whole of society. But could it be that people are rational yet not equally sovereign? In this paper, we examine Smith's interpretation of rationality, and we find that it is fundamentally a social concept. As such, the manifestation of rationality in individual behavior depends on how sophisticated is individuals' access to public opinion. Consequently, individuals who are equally self-interested may face very different sets of options, which are determined by their social circumstances. This difference may suggest that, although all agents may be motivated by the same objective, they cannot be considered as equally sovereign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & Am.

While the theory has intuitive appeal, it remains controversial. This study considers a data set first presented by Levitt and Venkatesh (2000) that details a drug-selling gang's activities. In this gang, low-ranking criminals accept low initial wages in the hope of receiving high future remunerations. As demonstrated in the note, this wage structure is exceedingly difficult to reconcile (both theoretically and empirically) with the notion of present-oriented criminals.

We are also interested in the consumer as a supplier of labor services who is faced with an increase in offered wages. In both cases we postulate a less than instantaneous response to market change, which phenomenon we term an inertial interval. Note is taken of previous work by Armen A. Alchian relating time and elasticity. The present emphasis on consumer inertia is said not to be inconsistent with Alchian's view.

This is surprising, as Miksch provides insights into the debates within the so-called \"Freiburg School of Law and Economics\" in its early phase and, moreover, gave impulses that were essential to the further development of this economic approach. In addition, as a close advisor to Ludwig Erhard, the \"political father\" of the German \"Social Market Economy,\" his influence on German postwar economic policy was considerable. Furthermore, Miksch's thinking on the combination of market forms and market constitution, as formulated primarily in his habilitation thesis on \"Competition as Task\" (1937) supervised by Walter Eucken, is unique and inventive. We will show that his ideas on economic policy culminating in the reference model of \"competition as-if\" as well as the connection he established with the economic foundation of democracy are of enduring relevance. The latter insight characterizes Miksch as an (overlooked) precursor of constitutional economics, which was later developed independently by James M. Buchanan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & Am.

There is, however, no doubt that such a market-oriented sociology is still in its infancy, given among other issues its inability to shoulder market change. The void thus recognized opens up the potential for a market idea with both social and dynamic properties. There is good reason to believe that such an endeavor would benefit from the constructive blending of economic sociology and Austrian economics.

The model captures a basic trade-off between sheltering the child from the consequences of his mistakes and allowing him to learn from experience.

The effects of these reforms depend on the market where control rights over incumbent firms are traded. In the absence of a market for control, both reforms increase the number and the average quality of firms, and are politically equivalent. When a market for control exists, financial reform induces less entry than deregulation, and endogenously compensates incumbents, thereby encountering less political opposition from them. Using this result, we show that financial reform may be used in the short run to open the way for future deregulation. Our model sheds light on the privatization and reform experiences of formerly planned economies as well as on the observed path of reforms in economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Q.

The analysis uses a new data set that links criminal justice data to child protection data in Illinois, and I find that investigators affect foster care placement. Children on the margin of placement are found to be two to three times more likely to enter the criminal justice system as adults if they were placed in foster care.

The winner's curse hypothesis posits suboptimal behavior in which winning bidders fail to adapt their strategies to the level of competition and the amount of uncertainty in the takeover environment and predicts that bidder returns are inversely related to the level of competition in a given deal and to the uncertainty in the value of the target. Our measure of takeover competition comes from a unique data set on the auction process that occurs prior to the announcement of a takeover. In our empirical estimation, we control for the endogeneity between bidder returns and the level of competition in takeover deals. Controlling for endogeneity, we find that the returns to bidders are not significantly related to takeover competition. We also find that uncertainty in the value of the target does not reduce bidder returns. Related analysis indicates that prestigious investment banks do not promote overbidding. Analysis of post-takeover operating performance also fails to find any negative effects of takeover competition. As a whole, the results indicate that the breakeven returns to bidders in corporate takeovers stem not from the winner's curse but from the competitive market for targets that occurs predominantly prior to the public announcement of bids.

We show that these abnormal returns are associated with proxies for lower expected expropriation costs. Specifically, we show that wealth creation increases in the degree of domestic geographic expansion afforded by the acquisition (increasing tobacco firms' influence in more political districts) and in the liquidity of tobacco firms' assets (converting cash to harder-to-expropriate operating assets). We also show that the threat of expropriation constrains payments to shareholders before expropriation becomes certain in 1998. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The model is consistent with several stylized facts known about the IPO market: economic expansions are associated with a dramatic increase in the number of firms going public, which is in turn positively correlated with underpricing. Adverse selection is procyclical in the sense that dispersion in unobservable quality across firms should be more pronounced during booms. Taking the premise that uncertainty is resolved (and thus private information revealed) over time, we test this hypothesis by looking at long-rum abnormal returns and delisting rates. Consistent with the model, we find (a) greater cross-sectional return variance, and (b) higher incidence of delisting for hot-market IPOs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Overconfident CEOs overestimate their ability to generate returns. As a result, they overpay for target companies and undertake value-destroying mergers. The effects are strongest if they have access to internal financing. We test these predictions using two proxies for overconfidence: CEOs' personal over-investment in their company and their press portrayal. We find that the odds of making an acquisition are 65% higher if the CEO is classified as overconfident. The effect is largest if the merger is diversifying and does not require external financing. The market reaction at merger announcement (-90 basis points) is significantly more negative than for non-overconfident CEOs (-12 basis points). We consider alternative interpretations including inside information, signaling, and risk tolerance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The increase in loan spread is significantly larger for fraudulent restating firms than other restating firms. We also find that after restatement, the number of lenders per loan declines and firms pay higher upfront and annual fees.

Although there are hints of reductions in the propensity to pay dividends in most of the sample countries over the 1994-2002 period, they are driven by a failure of newly listed firms to initiate dividends when expected to do so. Dividend abandonment and the failure to initiate by existing nonpayers are economically unimportant except in Japan. Moreover, in each country, aggregate dividends have not declined and are concentrated among the largest. most profitable firms. Finally, outside of the US there is little evidence of a systematic positive relation between relative prices of dividend paying and non-paying firms and the propensity to pay dividends. Overall, these findings cast doubt on signaling, clientele. and catering explanations for dividends, but support agency cost-based lifecycle theories. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To shed light on this important question, I develop a simple model of two candidate electoral competitions in which candidates may be either office or policy motivated. In a second departure from standard formulations, the model incorporates both campaign and post-election behaviour of candidates. In this environment, I find that office-motivated candidates are favoured in electoral competition but that their advantage is limited by the electoral mechanism itself and policy-motivated candidates win a significant fraction of elections. More importantly, I show that the competitive interaction among candidates of different motivations affects the incentives of all candidates-both office and policy motivated-and that this competition affects policy outcomes. I also extend the model to explore the decision of citizens to enter politics and show that in all equilibria policy-motivated citizens compose a majority of the candidate pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Rev.

Political parties are less likely to choose partisan policies when more voters consume informative news. When there are two media outlets, each should be slightly biased relative to its audience in order to attract voters with relatively extreme views. Voter welfare is typically higher under a duopoly than under a monopoly. Two media outlets under joint ownership may provide more diverse viewpoints than two independent ones, but voter welfare is not always higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Rev.

In our laboratory experiments, subjects play a set of 14 two-person 3 x 3 games and state beliefs about which actions they expect their opponents to play. The data sets from the two tasks are largely inconsistent. Rather, we find evidence that the subjects perceive the games differently when they (i) choose actions and (ii) state beliefs-their stated beliefs reveal deeper strategic thinking than their actions. On average, they fail to best respond to their own stated beliefs in almost half of the games. The inconsistency is confirmed by estimates of a unified statistical model that jointly uses the actions and the belief statements. There, we can control for decision noise and formulate a statistical test that rejects consistency.

Using detailed plot-level data from rural Pakistan, we find that non-contractible investment is underprovided on tenanted land, even after controlling for the endogeneity of leasing decisions. Our evidence also indicates that moral hazard in investment effort alone cannot explain this inefficiency. Instead, imperfect commitment appears to be the driving mechanism, since even plots taken on fixed rent contracts where all the rent is paid upfront receive lower investment than owner-cultivated plots. We further show that a considerable portion of the variation in tenancy duration, and hence in the security of tenure, is due to heterogeneity across landlords. One interpretation of this finding is that landlord reputation is important in mitigating hold-up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Rev.

For a calibrated economy, we find that when the only tax base available to the government is capital income-an inelastic source of funds at any point in time-the government still refrains from taxing at confiscatory rates.

In particular, it shows that competitive financial contracts can result in excessive borrowing ex ante and excessive volatility ex post. Even though from a first-best perspective the equilibrium always displays under-borrowing, from a second-best point of view excessive borrowing can arise. The inefficiency is due to the combination of limited commitment in financial contracts and the fact that asset prices are determined in a spot market. This generates a pecuniary externality that is not internalized in private contracts. The model provides a framework to evaluate preventive policies, which can be used during a credit boom to reduce the expected costs of a financial crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Rev.

We show that the conventional wisdom that trade promotes peace is only partially true even in a model where trade is economically beneficial, military conflicts reduce trade, and leaders are rational. When war can occur because of the presence of asymmetric information, the probability of escalation is lower for countries that trade more bilaterally because of the opportunity cost associated with the loss of trade gains. However, countries more open to global trade have a higher probability of war because multilateral trade openness decreases bilateral dependence to any given country and the cost of a bilateral conflict. We test our predictions on a large data set of military conflicts on the 1950-2000 period. Using different strategies to solve the endogeneity issues, including instrumental variables, we find robust evidence for the contrasting effects of bilateral and multilateral trade openness. For proximate countries, we find that trade has had a surprisingly large effect on their probability of military conflict.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Rev.

From a positive standpoint, the KFG rule is at odds with many episodes in which the central bank has plenty of international reserves at the time of abandonment. We study the optimal exit policy and show that from a normative standpoint, the KFG rule is generally suboptimal. We consider a model in which the fixed exchange rate regime has become unsustainable due to an unexpected increase in government spending. We show that when there are no exit costs, it is optimal to abandon immediately. When there are exit costs, the optimal abandonment time is a decreasing function of the size of the fiscal shock. For large fiscal shocks, immediate abandonment is optimal.

The risk-averse agent receives consumption continuously. The optimal contract, based on the agent's continuation value as a state variable, is computed by a new method using a differential equation. During employment, the output path stochastically drives the agent's continuation value until it reaches a point that triggers retirement, quitting, replacement, or promotion. The paper explores how the dynamics of the agent's wages and effort, as well as the optimal mix of short-term and long-term incentives, depend on the contractual environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Rev.

The error term epsilon is assumed to be uncorrelated with a set of instruments z, epsilon is independent of upsilon conditionally on x and z, and the support of - (x beta + epsilon) is finite. We provide a sharp characterization of the set of observationally equivalent parameters beta. When there are as many instruments z as variables x, the bounds of the identified intervals of the different scalar components beta(k) of parameter beta can be expressed as simple moments of the data. Also, in the case of interval data, we show that additional information on the distribution of upsilon within intervals shrinks the identified set. Specifically, the closer the conditional distribution of upsilon given z is to uniformity, the smaller is the identified set. Point identified is achieved if and only if upsilon is uniform within intervals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Rev.

This strategy makes sense if the poor are rate insensitive: then microlenders increase profitability (or achieve sustainability) without reducing the poor's access to credit. We test the assumption of price inelastic demand using randomized trials conducted by a consumer lender in South Africa. The demand curves are downward sloping, and sleeper for price increases relative to the lender's standard rates. We also find that loan size is far more responsive to changes in loan maturity than to changes in interest rates, which is consistent with binding liquidity constraints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Am.

We also investigate the strategic properties of the student-optimal stable mechanism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Am.

This paper develops a small open economy model to study default risk and its interaction with output and foreign debt. Default probabilities and interest rates depend on incentives for repayment. Default is more likely in recessions because this is when it is more costly for a risk averse borrower to repay noncontingent debt. The model closely matches business cycles in Argentina predicting high volatility of interest rates, higher volatility of consumption relative to output, and negative correlations of output with interest rates and the trade balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Am.

Persistent habits, consumption commitments, and subsistence levels can generate time-varying risk aversion with the consequence that when the level of liquid wealth changes, the proportion a household invests in risky assets should also change in the same direction. In contrast, our analysis shows that the share of liquid assets that households invest in risky assets is not affected by wealth changes. Instead, one of the major drivers of household portfolio allocation seems to be inertia: households rebalance only very slowly following inflows and outflows or capital gains and losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Am.

Consequently, investment prices should fully reflect temporary tax subsidies, regardless of the investment supply elasticity. Since prices move one for-one with the subsidy, elasticities can be inferred from quantities alone. This paper uses a recent tax policy-bonus depreciation-to estimate the investment supply elasticity. Investment in qualified capital increased sharply. The estimated elasticity is high-between 6 and 14. There is no evidence that market prices reacted to the subsidy, suggesting that adjustment costs are internal, or that measurement error masks the price changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Am.

Nevertheless, little is known about children's comprehension about occupational hierarchy related to what adults in distinct occupations are able to consume and save. The aim of this study was to analyze this comprehension in order to understand the development of concepts that interweave in children's and adolescents' societal and economic knowledge. Two hundred and ten children between 6 and 16 years of age were sampled from urban and rural social backgrounds. The children were individually interviewed about what four persons with distinct occupations consume and save. The results show that, across all occupations, children are more likely to identify saving as a likely response to obtaining extra income from a raffle as they get older. In terms of identifying motives for saving, mentions of saving for future purchases decrease with age, whilst precautionary saving and saving for investment are mentioned more often by older children.

The objective of this study conducted in China was to test the relative contribution of the cognitive developmental model and the social learning model with a focus on television and parents as socializing agents. Using a sample of 1758 children ages 6-14 and their parents living in three Mainland Chinese cities with different levels of advertising development, we examined children's understanding of television advertising by age utilizing a verbal method. Results of logistic regression analyses indicated that the cognitive developmental model made a greater contribution to predicting children's understanding of commercial communications than the social learning model. Chinese parents were not important socializing agents and television played some role ill children's consumer socialization. Gender, household income and the media environment had impact oil children's understanding of commercial communications. Girls and children from families with high household income had a higher understanding.

The economic problems children face in real life were used as the basis to design it game. Children played this game in two studies: The first Study investigated the saving strategies used by 42 children (14 each at 6, 9, and 12 years of age) when saving up tokens for a chosen target toy. In this study, the length of the game, and therefore the future, was unknown to the players. Results Suggest that between the ages nine and twelve children acquire the ability to manage their money on a formal level; e.g. they learn to deal with bank accounts and banking facilities in a useful, functional way. Twelve-year-olds frequently made use of the deposit facility of the bank in order to avoid temptation. For the second study, the game was altered so that children's ability to adopt a precautionary saving Motive Could be examined. In this study, players were told about the length of the game. Thirty-six children (nineteen 6-8 year olds and sixteen 10-11 year olds) took part, with both age groups being equally successful but using different strategies to cope with high or low fluctuations in income during the game.

The article also addresses his view of the importance of the professions to an understanding of the nature of advanced capitalism. The professions are discussed as both an illustration of his theoretical argument and a substantive problem that stimulated the development of his theory. The \"professional complex\" is an emergent phenomenon in capitalism that modifies its operation and points to the complexity of systems of social action that require to be analyzed without being reduced to one of their elements. This reductionism is evident in orthodox economic theory and also in the more sociologically-oriented approach of institutional economics. Parsons argues that each is a form of what, following Whitehead, he calls the \"fallacy of misplaced concreteness.\" Although Parsons offers a significant critique of dominant approaches in economics, major flaws within his own theory create the appearance that he has simply carried over the deficiencies of orthodox theory into his own general statement of theory. These flaws contribute to major misunderstandings of Parsons's project and, therefore, indicate continuing problems in the relation between economics and sociology. | Am. J. Econ.

Parsons's contributions on this subject were, however, mostly critically received in the new economic sociology. In this article, main points of criticism of Parsons's economic sociology will be discussed and the question asked whether the importance of Parsons's works in economic sociology was adequately treated. It will be demonstrated that the critical assessments was based for the most part on theoretical conceptions Parsons developed during his structural-functionalist period. Hence the assessments neglected to discuss the theory of expressive-symbolic communication of affect that Parsons developed in his later systems-functionalist period. However, precisely these later theoretical developments correlate directly with the concept of social embeddedness as a key concept in the new economic sociology. A stronger linking with this development in Parsons's theory could bring economic sociology closer to finding a foundation in action theory, which has been missing up to the present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Am.

While a considerable body of empirical investigations seems to provide evidence of positive correlations between stock market development and economic growth, there is no consensus in other social sciences as to whether there are two-way linkages, and if so, how to conceive a possible mechanism of interaction. Particularly, the hypergrowth and ubiquity of financial markets has triggered controversial debates on how to understand today's economic landscape. With the objective of clarifying the relationship between finance and economy, this article restructures the present debate through the lenses of Talcott Parsons's and Niklas Luhmann's theories of social systems. Basic system-theoretical ideas on social aspects of finance and economy as well as on uncertainty and risk hint at new insights into the global system of finance that might go far beyond explanatory models of causality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Am.

These bridges are methodological or epistemological and theoretical or substantive ones. A relevant instance of the methodological bridges is socioeconomic holism, epitomized in the systems approach to economy and society. An important case of the theoretical bridges is sociological institutionalism. The holistic systems approach is a pertinent methodological bridge in that it treats the economy as an integral element of society as a larger system, and consequently treats economics as part of the complex of social sciences. Sociological institutionalism is an important theoretical bridge to (especially institutional) economics by virtue of its emphasis on social institutions and their economic significance. Some other methodological and theoretical bridges of Parsonian economic sociology to contemporary economics are also identified and discussed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Am.

Feedback about the self-other discrepancy could correct the misperception and improve compliance. This approach was first tested in a scenario study with 64 students. Respondents showed the expected self-other discrepancy in tax ethics and feedback about the finding increased their hypothetical compliance. Further results showed that the effect was due to the intervention improving the perception of others' tax ethics, as expected. Study 2, a field experiment with 1500 Australian taxpayers, replicated the self-other discrepancy and provided taxpayers with information about the result.

Findings revealed that 50% of respondents had structuralistic, almost 30% had individualistic, and about 20% hold fatalistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty. Farmers with individualistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty had higher quality of life, well-being, level of agricultural technology, agricultural production, used insurance more often, they had more land, income, access to agricultural extension services and practiced sustainable agriculture more often. Farmers with fatalistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty had the worst condition with regard to the above variables.

A sample of household partners judged the fairness of a number of hypothetical decisions of a household partner, varying in the context of the decision. Decisions made by the partner to make a large personal expenditure or to reduce time spent on household chores were considered by the subjects as more fair if the outcome was framed as a forgone gain then if it was framed as a straight loss. Partners' decisions to reduce household chores were also considered as more fair in the case of overtime work than when the partner received a salary increase or windfall income. We conclude that asymmetric valuation of losses and forgone gains, and (behavioral) costs as compared with income increase of the partner, influenced the fairness judgments concerning the partner's behavior.

An efficient allocation of items is characterized, which may satisfy such properties as maximin, Borda maximin, and envy-avoidance. Whereas the two maximin properties are in conflict with envy-avoidance, there is always an efficient allocation that does not ensure envy, but it may not be maximin or Borda maximin.

Political science has offered two explanations for this. First, co-operation is difficult to achieve as a result of heterogeneity. Countries with a small domestic tax base favor tax competition, while countries with a large tax base prefer tax co-operation. Second, co-operation is difficult as a consequence of specific characteristics of the collective action problem involved. The actors face a prisoners' dilemma. Both explanations have their limits. The first approach is not very good at predicting actual policy preferences of governments and the second approach dismisses the fact that the EU offers cooperative institutions that should be able to resolve a dilemma.

Our study suggests that problems befalling landowners decline as trails are established and the work provided by snowmobile associations intensifies.

The average increase in the psychological distress is greater when outstanding credit is measured at the individual, as opposed to household, level. No such significant association is found in the case of mortgage debt. Our results highlight the psychological cost associated with the consumer credit culture in Britain. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In doing so, it offers several new features: Firstly, it provides a joint analysis of lotteries and income distributions. Secondly, the stimulus material used is considerably more general than used so far in the analysis of preference reversal. Instead of relying on binary lotteries and income distributions, we used ten multiple-outcome lotteries and ten n-dimensional income distributions which corresponded exactly to the lotteries. The lotteries and income distributions were chosen so as to model generalized P-bets (negatively skewed distributions) and generalized $-bets (positively skewed distributions), but we also used other shapes (uniform, symmetrical, and bimodal distributions). Thirdly, we applied material incentives to our subjects which were recruited from students of the Universities of Bari, Italy, and Castellon, Spain. Subjects were asked both to rate and evaluate the ten lotteries or the ten income distributions, respectively. We found heavy response-mode effects which confirm classical preference reversal, and revealed new patterns of preference reversal. Further, the transfer principle was largely violated.

Mutual cooperation is triggered by assuming that what one person passes on to the next is multiplied by a factor of 3. Participants play repeatedly either in a partners or in a strangers condition and take their decisions first simultaneously and then sequentially.

As we are all equally sovereign (cognitive-wise), we only strike deals that inevitably make us better off. We all gain from trade and thus, as everyone is better off, so must be the whole of society. But could it be that people are rational yet not equally sovereign? In this paper, we examine Smith's interpretation of rationality, and we find that it is fundamentally a social concept. As such, the manifestation of rationality in individual behavior depends on how sophisticated is individuals' access to public opinion. Consequently, individuals who are equally self-interested may face very different sets of options, which are determined by their social circumstances. This difference may suggest that, although all agents may be motivated by the same objective, they cannot be considered as equally sovereign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Am.

While the theory has intuitive appeal, it remains controversial. This study considers a data set first presented by Levitt and Venkatesh (2000) that details a drug-selling gang's activities. In this gang, low-ranking criminals accept low initial wages in the hope of receiving high future remunerations. As demonstrated in the note, this wage structure is exceedingly difficult to reconcile (both theoretically and empirically) with the notion of present-oriented criminals.

This is surprising, as Miksch provides insights into the debates within the so-called \"Freiburg School of Law and Economics\" in its early phase and, moreover, gave impulses that were essential to the further development of this economic approach. In addition, as a close advisor to Ludwig Erhard, the \"political father\" of the German \"Social Market Economy,\" his influence on German postwar economic policy was considerable. Furthermore, Miksch's thinking on the combination of market forms and market constitution, as formulated primarily in his habilitation thesis on \"Competition as Task\" (1937) supervised by Walter Eucken, is unique and inventive. We will show that his ideas on economic policy culminating in the reference model of \"competition as-if\" as well as the connection he established with the economic foundation of democracy are of enduring relevance. The latter insight characterizes Miksch as an (overlooked) precursor of constitutional economics, which was later developed independently by James M. Buchanan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Am.

There is, however, no doubt that such a market-oriented sociology is still in its infancy, given among other issues its inability to shoulder market change. The void thus recognized opens up the potential for a market idea with both social and dynamic properties. There is good reason to believe that such an endeavor would benefit from the constructive blending of economic sociology and Austrian economics. This paper argues that such a \"socio-Austrian\" connection is in the position to enrich the socioeconomic discourse in general and its market conception in particular.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Am.

       "1    We propose a simple theoretical model of supervised learning that is potentially useful to interpret a number of empirical phenomena relevant to the nature-nurture debate. The model captures a basic trade-off between sheltering the child from the consequences of his mistakes and allowing him to learn from experience. We characterize the optimal parenting policy and its comparative-statics properties. We then show that key features of the optimal policy can be useful to interpret provocative findings from behavioral genetics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "2    In a model with heterogeneity in managerial talent, we compare the economic and political consequences of reforms aimed at reducing fixed costs of entry (deregulation) and improving the efficiency of financial markets (financial reform). The effects of these reforms depend on the market where control rights over incumbent firms are traded. In the absence of a market for control, both reforms increase the number and the average quality of firms, and are politically equivalent. When a market for control exists, financial reform induces less entry than deregulation, and endogenously compensates incumbents, thereby encountering less political opposition from them. Using this result, we show that financial reform may be used in the short run to open the way for future deregulation. Our model sheds light on the privatization and reform experiences of formerly planned economies as well as on the observed path of reforms in economies of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "3    This paper uses the randomization of families to child protection investigators to estimate causal effects of foster care on adult crime. The analysis uses a new data set that links criminal justice data to child protection data in Illinois, and I find that investigators affect foster care placement. Children on the margin of placement are found to be two to three times more likely to enter the criminal justice system as adults if they were placed in foster care. One innovation describes the types of children on the margin of placement, a group that is more likely to include African Americans, girls, and young adolescents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "4    We contrast the winner's curse hypothesis and the competitive market hypothesis as potential explanations for the observed returns to bidders in corporate takeovers. The winner's curse hypothesis posits suboptimal behavior in which winning bidders fail to adapt their strategies to the level of competition and the amount of uncertainty in the takeover environment and predicts that bidder returns are inversely related to the level of competition in a given deal and to the uncertainty in the value of the target. Our measure of takeover competition comes from a unique data set on the auction process that occurs prior to the announcement of a takeover. In our empirical estimation, we control for the endogeneity between bidder returns and the level of competition in takeover deals. Controlling for endogeneity, we find that the returns to bidders are not significantly related to takeover competition. We also find that uncertainty in the value of the target does not reduce bidder returns. Related analysis indicates that prestigious investment banks do not promote overbidding. Analysis of post-takeover operating performance also fails to find any negative effects of takeover competition. As a whole, the results indicate that the breakeven returns to bidders in corporate takeovers stem not from the winner's curse but from the competitive market for targets that occurs predominantly prior to the public announcement of bids.

       "5    While it is well established that diversifying acquisitions by large, cash-rich firms destroy shareholder wealth, we document positive abnormal returns to such acquisitions in the tobacco industry. We show that these abnormal returns are associated with proxies for lower expected expropriation costs. Specifically, we show that wealth creation increases in the degree of domestic geographic expansion afforded by the acquisition (increasing tobacco firms' influence in more political districts) and in the liquidity of tobacco firms' assets (converting cash to harder-to-expropriate operating assets). We also show that the threat of expropriation constrains payments to shareholders before expropriation becomes certain in 1998. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

       "6    We develop a model in which time-varying real investment opportunities lead to time-varying adverse selection in the market for IPOs. The model is consistent with several stylized facts known about the IPO market: economic expansions are associated with a dramatic increase in the number of firms going public, which is in turn positively correlated with underpricing. Adverse selection is procyclical in the sense that dispersion in unobservable quality across firms should be more pronounced during booms. Taking the premise that uncertainty is resolved (and thus private information revealed) over time, we test this hypothesis by looking at long-rum abnormal returns and delisting rates. Consistent with the model, we find (a) greater cross-sectional return variance, and (b) higher incidence of delisting for hot-market IPOs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

       "7    Does CEO overconfidence help to explain merger decisions? Overconfident CEOs overestimate their ability to generate returns. As a result, they overpay for target companies and undertake value-destroying mergers. The effects are strongest if they have access to internal financing. We test these predictions using two proxies for overconfidence: CEOs' personal over-investment in their company and their press portrayal. We find that the odds of making an acquisition are 65% higher if the CEO is classified as overconfident. The effect is largest if the merger is diversifying and does not require external financing. The market reaction at merger announcement (-90 basis points) is significantly more negative than for non-overconfident CEOs (-12 basis points). We consider alternative interpretations including inside information, signaling, and risk tolerance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

       "8    This paper is the first to study the effect of financial restatement on bank loan contracting. Compared with loans initiated before restatement, loans initiated after restatement have significantly higher spreads, shorter maturities, higher likelihood of being secured, and More covenant restrictions. The increase in loan spread is significantly larger for fraudulent restating firms than other restating firms. We also find that after restatement, the number of lenders per loan declines and firms pay higher upfront and annual fees. These results are consistent with banks using tighter loan contract terms to overcome risk and information problems arising from financial restatements. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

       "9    In the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, and Japan, the propensity to pay dividends is higher among larger, more profitable firms, and those for which retained earnings comprise a large fraction of total equity. Although there are hints of reductions in the propensity to pay dividends in most of the sample countries over the 1994-2002 period, they are driven by a failure of newly listed firms to initiate dividends when expected to do so. Dividend abandonment and the failure to initiate by existing nonpayers are economically unimportant except in Japan. Moreover, in each country, aggregate dividends have not declined and are concentrated among the largest. most profitable firms. Finally, outside of the US there is little evidence of a systematic positive relation between relative prices of dividend paying and non-paying firms and the propensity to pay dividends. Overall, these findings cast doubt on signaling, clientele. and catering explanations for dividends, but support agency cost-based lifecycle theories. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

       "10   This paper considers an optimal taxation environment where household income is private information, and the government randomly audits and punishes households found to be underreporting. We prove that the optimal mechanism derived using standard mechanism design techniques has a bad equilibrium (a tax riot) where households underreport their incomes, precisely because other households are expected to do so as well. We then consider three alternative approaches to designing a tax scheme when one is worried about bad equilibria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "11   Are politicians motivated by policy outcomes or by the perks of office? To shed light on this important question, I develop a simple model of two candidate electoral competitions in which candidates may be either office or policy motivated. In a second departure from standard formulations, the model incorporates both campaign and post-election behaviour of candidates. In this environment, I find that office-motivated candidates are favoured in electoral competition but that their advantage is limited by the electoral mechanism itself and policy-motivated candidates win a significant fraction of elections. More importantly, I show that the competitive interaction among candidates of different motivations affects the incentives of all candidates-both office and policy motivated-and that this competition affects policy outcomes. I also extend the model to explore the decision of citizens to enter politics and show that in all equilibria policy-motivated citizens compose a majority of the candidate pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "12   We characterize the optimal editorial positions of the media in a model in which the media influence both voting behaviour and party policies. Political parties are less likely to choose partisan policies when more voters consume informative news. When there are two media outlets, each should be slightly biased relative to its audience in order to attract voters with relatively extreme views. Voter welfare is typically higher under a duopoly than under a monopoly. Two media outlets under joint ownership may provide more diverse viewpoints than two independent ones, but voter welfare is not always higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "13   Using data on one-shot games, we investigate whether players' actions can be viewed as responses to underlying expectations about their opponent's behaviour. In our laboratory experiments, subjects play a set of 14 two-person 3 x 3 games and state beliefs about which actions they expect their opponents to play. The data sets from the two tasks are largely inconsistent. Rather, we find evidence that the subjects perceive the games differently when they (i) choose actions and (ii) state beliefs-their stated beliefs reveal deeper strategic thinking than their actions. On average, they fail to best respond to their own stated beliefs in almost half of the games. The inconsistency is confirmed by estimates of a unified statistical model that jointly uses the actions and the belief statements. There, we can control for decision noise and formulate a statistical test that rejects consistency. Effects of the belief elicitation procedure on subsequent actions are mostly insignificant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "14   Commitment failure lies at the core of incomplete contract theory, yet its quantitative significance has rarely been assessed. Using detailed plot-level data from rural Pakistan, we find that non-contractible investment is underprovided on tenanted land, even after controlling for the endogeneity of leasing decisions. Our evidence also indicates that moral hazard in investment effort alone cannot explain this inefficiency. Instead, imperfect commitment appears to be the driving mechanism, since even plots taken on fixed rent contracts where all the rent is paid upfront receive lower investment than owner-cultivated plots. We further show that a considerable portion of the variation in tenancy duration, and hence in the security of tenure, is due to heterogeneity across landlords. One interpretation of this finding is that landlord reputation is important in mitigating hold-up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "15   In this paper we study how a benevolent government that cannot commit to future policy should trade off the costs and benefits of public expenditure. We characterize and solve for Markov-perfect equilibria of the dynamic game between successive governments. The characterization consists of an inter-temporal first-order condition (a \"generalized Euler equation\") for the government, and we use it both to gain insight into the nature of the equilibrium and as a basis for computations. For a calibrated economy, we find that when the only tax base available to the government is capital income-an inelastic source of funds at any point in time-the government still refrains from taxing at confiscatory rates. We also find that when the only tax base is labour income the Markov equilibrium features less public expenditure and lower tax rates than the Ramsey equilibrium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "16   This paper studies the welfare properties of competitive equilibria in an economy with financial frictions hit by aggregate shocks. In particular, it shows that competitive financial contracts can result in excessive borrowing ex ante and excessive volatility ex post. Even though from a first-best perspective the equilibrium always displays under-borrowing, from a second-best point of view excessive borrowing can arise. The inefficiency is due to the combination of limited commitment in financial contracts and the fact that asset prices are determined in a spot market. This generates a pecuniary externality that is not internalized in private contracts. The model provides a framework to evaluate preventive policies, which can be used during a credit boom to reduce the expected costs of a financial crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "17   This paper analyses theoretically and empirically the relationship between military conflicts and trade. We show that the conventional wisdom that trade promotes peace is only partially true even in a model where trade is economically beneficial, military conflicts reduce trade, and leaders are rational. When war can occur because of the presence of asymmetric information, the probability of escalation is lower for countries that trade more bilaterally because of the opportunity cost associated with the loss of trade gains. However, countries more open to global trade have a higher probability of war because multilateral trade openness decreases bilateral dependence to any given country and the cost of a bilateral conflict. We test our predictions on a large data set of military conflicts on the 1950-2000 period. Using different strategies to solve the endogeneity issues, including instrumental variables, we find robust evidence for the contrasting effects of bilateral and multilateral trade openness. For proximate countries, we find that trade has had a surprisingly large effect on their probability of military conflict.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

The equilibrium equation system enables us to characterize conditions for identification. We consider a class of asymptotic least squares estimators defined by the equilibrium conditions. This class provides a unified framework for a number of well-known estimators including those by Hotz and Miller (1993) and by Aguirregabiria and Mira (2002). We show that these estimators differ in the weight they assign to individual equilibrium conditions. We derive the efficient weight matrix.

       "19   The influential Krugman-Flood-Garber (KFG) model of balance of payment crises assumes that a fixed exchange rate is abandoned if and only if international reserves reach a critical threshold value. From a positive standpoint, the KFG rule is at odds with many episodes in which the central bank has plenty of international reserves at the time of abandonment. We study the optimal exit policy and show that from a normative standpoint, the KFG rule is generally suboptimal. We consider a model in which the fixed exchange rate regime has become unsustainable due to an unexpected increase in government spending. We show that when there are no exit costs, it is optimal to abandon immediately. When there are exit costs, the optimal abandonment time is a decreasing function of the size of the fiscal shock. For large fiscal shocks, immediate abandonment is optimal. Our model is consistent with evidence suggesting that many countries exit fixed exchange rate regimes with still plenty of international reserves in the central bank's vault.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "20   This paper describes a new continuous-time principal-agent model, in which the output is a diffusion process with drift determined by the agent's unobserved effort. The risk-averse agent receives consumption continuously. The optimal contract, based on the agent's continuation value as a state variable, is computed by a new method using a differential equation. During employment, the output path stochastically drives the agent's continuation value until it reaches a point that triggers retirement, quitting, replacement, or promotion. The paper explores how the dynamics of the agent's wages and effort, as well as the optimal mix of short-term and long-term incentives, depend on the contractual environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "21   We investigate identification in semi-parametric binary regression models, y = 1(x beta + upsilon + epsilon > 0) when upsilon is either discrete or measured within intervals. The error term epsilon is assumed to be uncorrelated with a set of instruments z, epsilon is independent of upsilon conditionally on x and z, and the support of - (x beta + epsilon) is finite. We provide a sharp characterization of the set of observationally equivalent parameters beta. When there are as many instruments z as variables x, the bounds of the identified intervals of the different scalar components beta(k) of parameter beta can be expressed as simple moments of the data. Also, in the case of interval data, we show that additional information on the distribution of upsilon within intervals shrinks the identified set. Specifically, the closer the conditional distribution of upsilon given z is to uniformity, the smaller is the identified set. Point identified is achieved if and only if upsilon is uniform within intervals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

We find that a history of unenforced property rights hinders our subjects' ability to develop the requisite personal social arrangements to support specialization and effectively exploit impersonal long-distance trade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "23   Policymakers often prescribe that microfinance institutions increase interest rates to eliminate their reliance on subsidies. This strategy makes sense if the poor are rate insensitive: then microlenders increase profitability (or achieve sustainability) without reducing the poor's access to credit. We test the assumption of price inelastic demand using randomized trials conducted by a consumer lender in South Africa. The demand curves are downward sloping, and sleeper for price increases relative to the lender's standard rates. We also find that loan size is far more responsive to changes in loan maturity than to changes in interest rates, which is consistent with binding liquidity constraints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

To this end, we propose the estimation of DSGE models allowing for time variation in the volatility of the structural innovations. We apply our estimation strategy to a large-scale model of the business cycle and find that shocks specific to the equilibrium condition of investment account for most of the sharp decline in volatility of the last two decades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "25   This paper presents an assignment model of CEOs and firms. The distributions of CEO pay levels and firms' market values are analyzed as the competitive equilibrium of a matching market where talents, as well as CEO positions, are scarce. It is shown how the observed joint distribution of CEO pay and market value can then be used to infer the economic value of underlying ability differences. The variation in CEO pay is found to be mostly due to variation in firm characteristics, whereas implied differences in managerial ability are small and make relatively little difference to shareholder value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "26   In several school choice districts in the United States, the student proposing deferred acceptance algorithm is applied after indifferences in priority orders are broken in some exogenous way. Although such a tie-breaking procedure preserves stability, it adversely affects the welfare of the students since it introduces artificial stability constraints. Our main finding is a polynomial-time algorithm for the computation of a student-optimal stable matching when priorities are weak. The idea behind our construction relies on a new notion which we call a stable improvement cycle. We also investigate the strategic properties of the student-optimal stable mechanism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "27   Recent sovereign defaults are accompanied by interest rate spikes and deep recessions. This paper develops a small open economy model to study default risk and its interaction with output and foreign debt. Default probabilities and interest rates depend on incentives for repayment. Default is more likely in recessions because this is when it is more costly for a risk averse borrower to repay noncontingent debt. The model closely matches business cycles in Argentina predicting high volatility of interest rates, higher volatility of consumption relative to output, and negative correlations of output with interest rates and the trade balance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "28   We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to investigate how households' portfolio allocations change in response to wealth fluctuations. Persistent habits, consumption commitments, and subsistence levels can generate time-varying risk aversion with the consequence that when the level of liquid wealth changes, the proportion a household invests in risky assets should also change in the same direction. In contrast, our analysis shows that the share of liquid assets that households invest in risky assets is not affected by wealth changes. Instead, one of the major drivers of household portfolio allocation seems to be inertia: households rebalance only very slowly following inflows and outflows or capital gains and losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "29   The intertemporal elasticity of investment for long-lived capital goods is nearly infinite. Consequently, investment prices should fully reflect temporary tax subsidies, regardless of the investment supply elasticity. Since prices move one for-one with the subsidy, elasticities can be inferred from quantities alone. This paper uses a recent tax policy-bonus depreciation-to estimate the investment supply elasticity. Investment in qualified capital increased sharply. The estimated elasticity is high-between 6 and 14. There is no evidence that market prices reacted to the subsidy, suggesting that adjustment costs are internal, or that measurement error masks the price changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "30   This paper analyzes how US presidential candidates should allocate resources across states to maximize the probability of winning the election, by developing and estimating a probabilistic-voting model of political competition under the Electoral College system. Actual campaigns act in close agreement with the model. There is a 0.9 correlation between equilibrium and actual presidential campaign visits across states, both in 2000 and 2004. The paper shows how presidential candidate attention is affected by the states' number of electoral votes, forecasted state-election outcomes, and forecast uncertainty. It also analyzes the effects of a direct national popular vote for president.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "6527 We examine the relationship between body size (specifically, weight and height) and dating and sexual activity using two large, nationally representative, longitudinal data sets. Our conceptual framework assumes that the utility an adolescent derives from dating and sexual activity is a function of the weight and height of his or her partner, and it predicts that heavier and shorter adolescents will be less likely to date and have sex. Empirical tests confirm that dating is less likely among heavier girls and boys and among shorter girls and boys. In adolescent dating, size clearly matters. For sexual activity, the results are less consistent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "6528 There have been a number of studies of children's and adolescents' conceptions about occupations and the social hierarchy and class levels they imply. Nevertheless, little is known about children's comprehension about occupational hierarchy related to what adults in distinct occupations are able to consume and save. The aim of this study was to analyze this comprehension in order to understand the development of concepts that interweave in children's and adolescents' societal and economic knowledge. Two hundred and ten children between 6 and 16 years of age were sampled from urban and rural social backgrounds. The children were individually interviewed about what four persons with distinct occupations consume and save. The results show that, across all occupations, children are more likely to identify saving as a likely response to obtaining extra income from a raffle as they get older. In terms of identifying motives for saving, mentions of saving for future purchases decrease with age, whilst precautionary saving and saving for investment are mentioned more often by older children.

       "6529 Parents and the media, especially television, have long been seen as important socializing agents that have impact on children's consumer socialization. The objective of this study conducted in China was to test the relative contribution of the cognitive developmental model and the social learning model with a focus on television and parents as socializing agents. Using a sample of 1758 children ages 6-14 and their parents living in three Mainland Chinese cities with different levels of advertising development, we examined children's understanding of television advertising by age utilizing a verbal method. Results of logistic regression analyses indicated that the cognitive developmental model made a greater contribution to predicting children's understanding of commercial communications than the social learning model. Chinese parents were not important socializing agents and television played some role ill children's consumer socialization. Gender, household income and the media environment had impact oil children's understanding of commercial communications. Girls and children from families with high household income had a higher understanding. Children residing in cities with the presence of public service advertising had a lower understanding of commercial communications. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The economic problems children face in real life were used as the basis to design it game. Children played this game in two studies: The first Study investigated the saving strategies used by 42 children (14 each at 6, 9, and 12 years of age) when saving up tokens for a chosen target toy. In this study, the length of the game, and therefore the future, was unknown to the players. Results Suggest that between the ages nine and twelve children acquire the ability to manage their money on a formal level; e.g. they learn to deal with bank accounts and banking facilities in a useful, functional way. Twelve-year-olds frequently made use of the deposit facility of the bank in order to avoid temptation. For the second study, the game was altered so that children's ability to adopt a precautionary saving Motive Could be examined. In this study, players were told about the length of the game. Thirty-six children (nineteen 6-8 year olds and sixteen 10-11 year olds) took part, with both age groups being equally successful but using different strategies to cope with high or low fluctuations in income during the game.

       "6531 This article discusses the relationship between economics and sociology in the context of Parsons's analytical theory of action and systems and his criticisms of orthodox and institutional economics. The article also addresses his view of the importance of the professions to an understanding of the nature of advanced capitalism. The professions are discussed as both an illustration of his theoretical argument and a substantive problem that stimulated the development of his theory. The \"professional complex\" is an emergent phenomenon in capitalism that modifies its operation and points to the complexity of systems of social action that require to be analyzed without being reduced to one of their elements. This reductionism is evident in orthodox economic theory and also in the more sociologically-oriented approach of institutional economics. Parsons argues that each is a form of what, following Whitehead, he calls the \"fallacy of misplaced concreteness.\" Although Parsons offers a significant critique of dominant approaches in economics, major flaws within his own theory create the appearance that he has simply carried over the deficiencies of orthodox theory into his own general statement of theory. These flaws contribute to major misunderstandings of Parsons's project and, therefore, indicate continuing problems in the relation between economics and sociology.                                                                                                  \n",
       "6532 The economy and economics are important fields in Talcott Parsons's work. Parsons's contributions on this subject were, however, mostly critically received in the new economic sociology. In this article, main points of criticism of Parsons's economic sociology will be discussed and the question asked whether the importance of Parsons's works in economic sociology was adequately treated. It will be demonstrated that the critical assessments was based for the most part on theoretical conceptions Parsons developed during his structural-functionalist period. Hence the assessments neglected to discuss the theory of expressive-symbolic communication of affect that Parsons developed in his later systems-functionalist period. However, precisely these later theoretical developments correlate directly with the concept of social embeddedness as a key concept in the new economic sociology. A stronger linking with this development in Parsons's theory could bring economic sociology closer to finding a foundation in action theory, which has been missing up to the present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "6533 In the last decades, revolutionary changes in financial markets, instruments, and institutions have stimulated empirical and theoretical investigations into the interaction of the financial and the \"real\" side of economic systems. While a considerable body of empirical investigations seems to provide evidence of positive correlations between stock market development and economic growth, there is no consensus in other social sciences as to whether there are two-way linkages, and if so, how to conceive a possible mechanism of interaction. Particularly, the hypergrowth and ubiquity of financial markets has triggered controversial debates on how to understand today's economic landscape. With the objective of clarifying the relationship between finance and economy, this article restructures the present debate through the lenses of Talcott Parsons's and Niklas Luhmann's theories of social systems. Basic system-theoretical ideas on social aspects of finance and economy as well as on uncertainty and risk hint at new insights into the global system of finance that might go far beyond explanatory models of causality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "6535 This article focuses on Parsonian economic sociology and its actual or potential bridges and contributions to contemporary economics. These bridges are methodological or epistemological and theoretical or substantive ones. A relevant instance of the methodological bridges is socioeconomic holism, epitomized in the systems approach to economy and society. An important case of the theoretical bridges is sociological institutionalism. The holistic systems approach is a pertinent methodological bridge in that it treats the economy as an integral element of society as a larger system, and consequently treats economics as part of the complex of social sciences. Sociological institutionalism is an important theoretical bridge to (especially institutional) economics by virtue of its emphasis on social institutions and their economic significance. Some other methodological and theoretical bridges of Parsonian economic sociology to contemporary economics are also identified and discussed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

While cognitive performance and educational attainment have been shown to be strong indicators of economic success, there remains a large portion of unexplained variance in earnings after controlling for the standard variables. This paper uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women and women from the National Child Development Study to explore the value of incorporating psychological traits into wage determination models. This research finds that traits such as locus of control, aggression, and withdrawal are all statistically significant factors in the wage determination models of white women. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

       "6537 The connection between Turkish industrial production performance and the success of a popular Turkish football team, namely Fenerbahce, is the central theme of this article. The success of Fenerbahce is interpreted as a proxy for the workers' mood or morale. Performing a transfer function analysis on our monthly data set, we reveal positive feedback from Fenerbahce's success, which proxies workers' mood/morale, to economic performance such that the monthly industrial growth rate increases by 0.26% with the number of games won by Fenerbahce in European cups regardless of where the game is played. Evidence of the effects of games against domestic rivals on industrial performance is not statistically significant. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

       "6538 Taxpayers may estimate others' acceptance of tax evasion as being greater than their own. This self-other discrepancy in tax ethics could undermine people's tax compliance as they conform to the misperceived social norm. Feedback about the self-other discrepancy could correct the misperception and improve compliance. This approach was first tested in a scenario study with 64 students. Respondents showed the expected self-other discrepancy in tax ethics and feedback about the finding increased their hypothetical compliance. Further results showed that the effect was due to the intervention improving the perception of others' tax ethics, as expected. Study 2, a field experiment with 1500 Australian taxpayers, replicated the self-other discrepancy and provided taxpayers with information about the result. Compared to control groups, the feedback did not affect work-related expenses claims but significantly reduced other deduction claims. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

       "6539 Causal attributions are important mediators of future behaviour because once a cause is assigned; a commensurate action can be taken. The aims of this research were to find how Iranian farmers attribute the causes of poverty, to provide a typology of attribution of causes of poverty as perceived by Iranian farmers and to compare socio-economic characteristics and contextual conditions of farmers based on their causal attribution of poverty type. Findings revealed that 50% of respondents had structuralistic, almost 30% had individualistic, and about 20% hold fatalistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty. Farmers with individualistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty had higher quality of life, well-being, level of agricultural technology, agricultural production, used insurance more often, they had more land, income, access to agricultural extension services and practiced sustainable agriculture more often. Farmers with fatalistic attitudes towards the causes of poverty had the worst condition with regard to the above variables. However, those who had structuralistic attitudes, stood somewhere between the two previous groups. Based on findings, a number of poverty alleviation recommendations are made. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

       "6540 The behavioral economic study of fairness was applied to household decision making. A sample of household partners judged the fairness of a number of hypothetical decisions of a household partner, varying in the context of the decision. Decisions made by the partner to make a large personal expenditure or to reduce time spent on household chores were considered by the subjects as more fair if the outcome was framed as a forgone gain then if it was framed as a straight loss. Partners' decisions to reduce household chores were also considered as more fair in the case of overtime work than when the partner received a salary increase or windfall income. We conclude that asymmetric valuation of losses and forgone gains, and (behavioral) costs as compared with income increase of the partner, influenced the fairness judgments concerning the partner's behavior.

       "6541 Two or more players rank a set of indivisible items from best to worst. An efficient allocation of items is characterized, which may satisfy such properties as maximin, Borda maximin, and envy-avoidance. Whereas the two maximin properties are in conflict with envy-avoidance, there is always an efficient allocation that does not ensure envy, but it may not be maximin or Borda maximin. Computer calculations show that maximin allocations lead to envy quite often, but Borda maximin allocations do so only rarely. Implications of the theoretical findings for real-world fair-division problems are discussed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "6542 It took the European Union (EU) 35 years to achieve a co-operative agreement on co-ordinated measures of savings taxation. Political science has offered two explanations for this. First, co-operation is difficult to achieve as a result of heterogeneity. Countries with a small domestic tax base favor tax competition, while countries with a large tax base prefer tax co-operation. Second, co-operation is difficult as a consequence of specific characteristics of the collective action problem involved. The actors face a prisoners' dilemma. Both explanations have their limits. The first approach is not very good at predicting actual policy preferences of governments and the second approach dismisses the fact that the EU offers cooperative institutions that should be able to resolve a dilemma. The paper refines these explanations such that the theory fits better the empirical positions of EU governments and their problems of finding an agreement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "6543 The prevailing approaches to collective action in the rational choice paradigm often lead to implausible conclusions and tend to lack predictive power. This article introduces a method to overcome these difficulties. The method is based oil the notion of stability sets of pure-strategy equilibria, already familiar from the literature on equilibrium selection and with close counterparts in evolutionary game theory. With the help of some simple examples, the article shows how this method can turn many intuitive insights into operational, testable hypotheses about phenomena of collective action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "6544 A snowmobile trail canalizes snow-covered land to create a path of snowmobile travel. This form of communication infrastructure yields two kinds of benefits. First, it reduces negative externalities befalling landowners and other non-drivers. Second, it improves driving conditions for both local inhabitants and leisure tourists enjoying outdoor recreation. Our study suggests that problems befalling landowners decline as trails are established and the work provided by snowmobile associations intensifies. We discuss various social mechanisms that facilitate self-organization, and suggest that the extensive voluntary provision of snowmobile trails in Sweden is ail example of how local common-pool resource dilemmas are resolved through self-organization, outside formal markets and beyond governmental politics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "6545 Asymmetric information is at the heart of situations involving trust. In the case of B2C Internet commerce, the information asymmetry typically relates to the difficulty that consumers have of distinguishing between \"trustworthy\" and \"untrustworthy\" Web merchants. The impasse can be resolved by the use of signals by trustworthy Web merchants to differentiate themselves from untrustworthy ones. Using an experimental design where subjects are exposed to a series of purchase choices, we investigate three possible signals, an unconditional money-back guarantee, branding, and privacy statement, and test their efficacy.

       "6546 This paper examines the relationship between openness, self-transcendence and self-enhancement values [Schwartz, S. H., & Sagiv, L. (1995). Identifying culture-specifics in the content and structure of values. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 26 (1), 92-116] and attitudes toward consumption as measured by the Richins and Dawson materialism scale [Richins M. L., & Dawson, S. (1992). A consumer values orientation for materialism and its measurement: Scale development and validation. Journal of Consumer Research, 19(December), 303-316]. The study encompassed three countries, Canada, Germany, and the US. The results indicated that both the materialism and value scales were invariant across countries and that the proposed causal model was invariant as well. The relationship between self-transcendence and materialism was negative, and the relationship between self-enhancement and materialism was positive. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

       "6547 In this paper we explore the association between debt and psychological well-being amongst heads of households using the British Household Panel Survey. Our principle finding is that those household heads who have outstanding (non-mortgage) credit, and who have higher amounts of such debt, are significantly less likely to report complete psychological well-being. The average increase in the psychological distress is greater when outstanding credit is measured at the individual, as opposed to household, level. No such significant association is found in the case of mortgage debt. Our results highlight the psychological cost associated with the consumer credit culture in Britain. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

       "6548 People contribute more to experimental public goods the more others contribute, a tendency called \"crowding-in.\" We propose a novel experimental design to distinguish two possible causes of crowding-in: reciprocity, the usual explanation, and conformity, a neglected alternative. Subjects are given the opportunity to react to contributions of a payoff-irrelevant group, in addition to their own group. We find evidence of conformity, accounting for roughly 1/3 of crowding-in.

       "6549 This paper investigates preference reversals both for lotteries and income distributions as well as their interrelationship. In doing so, it offers several new features: Firstly, it provides a joint analysis of lotteries and income distributions. Secondly, the stimulus material used is considerably more general than used so far in the analysis of preference reversal. Instead of relying on binary lotteries and income distributions, we used ten multiple-outcome lotteries and ten n-dimensional income distributions which corresponded exactly to the lotteries. The lotteries and income distributions were chosen so as to model generalized P-bets (negatively skewed distributions) and generalized $-bets (positively skewed distributions), but we also used other shapes (uniform, symmetrical, and bimodal distributions). Thirdly, we applied material incentives to our subjects which were recruited from students of the Universities of Bari, Italy, and Castellon, Spain. Subjects were asked both to rate and evaluate the ten lotteries or the ten income distributions, respectively. We found heavy response-mode effects which confirm classical preference reversal, and revealed new patterns of preference reversal. Further, the transfer principle was largely violated.

       "6550 A cyclical network of indirect reciprocity is derived organizing 3- or 6-person groups into rings of social interaction where the first individual may help the second, the second the third, and so on until the last, who in turn may help the first. Mutual cooperation is triggered by assuming that what one person passes on to the next is multiplied by a factor of 3. Participants play repeatedly either in a partners or in a strangers condition and take their decisions first simultaneously and then sequentially. We find that pure indirect reciprocity enables mutual cooperation, although strategic considerations and group size are important too. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

       "6551 Upon the uniformity in individuals' decision-making mechanism rests a great deal of the legitimacy of natural liberty. As we are all equally sovereign (cognitive-wise), we only strike deals that inevitably make us better off. We all gain from trade and thus, as everyone is better off, so must be the whole of society. But could it be that people are rational yet not equally sovereign? In this paper, we examine Smith's interpretation of rationality, and we find that it is fundamentally a social concept. As such, the manifestation of rationality in individual behavior depends on how sophisticated is individuals' access to public opinion. Consequently, individuals who are equally self-interested may face very different sets of options, which are determined by their social circumstances. This difference may suggest that, although all agents may be motivated by the same objective, they cannot be considered as equally sovereign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

A brief summary of the differing interpretations is offered. Citation analysis is used to examine the frequency with which Wicksell is cited and by whom. The sociology of the economics profession and avenues for the dissemination of ideas are examined to understand the dominance of Buchanan's particular interpretation and application of the unanimity rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "6553 Two prominent theories of crime (Wilson and Herrnstein 1985; Gottfredson and Hirshi 1990) rely heavily on the notion that criminals are impatient or \"present-oriented.\" In brief, the theories posit that present-oriented individuals will be predisposed to crime because the \"costs\" of crime (e.g., prison time) lag behind crime's benefits. While the theory has intuitive appeal, it remains controversial. This study considers a data set first presented by Levitt and Venkatesh (2000) that details a drug-selling gang's activities. In this gang, low-ranking criminals accept low initial wages in the hope of receiving high future remunerations. As demonstrated in the note, this wage structure is exceedingly difficult to reconcile (both theoretically and empirically) with the notion of present-oriented criminals. In sum, the study suggests that present orientation is at best an incomplete and idiosyncratic explanation of the causes of crime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "6554 This note seeks to explore one of the factors affecting a consumer who is faced with a price increase. We are also interested in the consumer as a supplier of labor services who is faced with an increase in offered wages. In both cases we postulate a less than instantaneous response to market change, which phenomenon we term an inertial interval. Note is taken of previous work by Armen A. Alchian relating time and elasticity. The present emphasis on consumer inertia is said not to be inconsistent with Alchian's view. The factors affecting consumer (and producer) inertia are referred to in general terms as habit and sensitivity to peer pressure, thus opening the discussion to psychosocial investigation of the behavior in question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "6555 German economist Leonhard Miksch's ideas on ordoliberalism have so far received little attention in the history of economic thought. This is surprising, as Miksch provides insights into the debates within the so-called \"Freiburg School of Law and Economics\" in its early phase and, moreover, gave impulses that were essential to the further development of this economic approach. In addition, as a close advisor to Ludwig Erhard, the \"political father\" of the German \"Social Market Economy,\" his influence on German postwar economic policy was considerable. Furthermore, Miksch's thinking on the combination of market forms and market constitution, as formulated primarily in his habilitation thesis on \"Competition as Task\" (1937) supervised by Walter Eucken, is unique and inventive. We will show that his ideas on economic policy culminating in the reference model of \"competition as-if\" as well as the connection he established with the economic foundation of democracy are of enduring relevance. The latter insight characterizes Miksch as an (overlooked) precursor of constitutional economics, which was later developed independently by James M. Buchanan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "6556 Economic sociology furthers a healthy alternative to price-theory-oriented economics as it sets out to remedy the invisibility of the market within the latter. There is, however, no doubt that such a market-oriented sociology is still in its infancy, given among other issues its inability to shoulder market change. The void thus recognized opens up the potential for a market idea with both social and dynamic properties. There is good reason to believe that such an endeavor would benefit from the constructive blending of economic sociology and Austrian economics. This paper argues that such a \"socio-Austrian\" connection is in the position to enrich the socioeconomic discourse in general and its market conception in particular.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
